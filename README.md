# HTML: Silently Vanishing Content

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to hiding elements without proper DOM management.  The initial `bug.html` file hides a div element using JavaScript, but it doesn't account for restoring visibility in subsequent actions. This leads to content that is seemingly lost, creating an unusual error condition.

The solution, found in `solution.html`, addresses this by providing methods for handling the div's visibility, showing how to avoid this silent failure.   This simple example highlights the need for comprehensive DOM manipulation strategies.
